# Type Challenges Answers

Answers to [type challenges](https://github.com/type-challenges/type-challenges).

## Setup

```
yarn install
```

## Solve

Create a new file named the same as the type challenge, copying and pasting the code from the TS playground page.

Complete the type challenge.

## Check

VSCode should show an error when the type is not correct.

But, you can also manually test by running the `test` command, providing the test number ID.
Eg: `4-easy-pick.ts` has an ID of `4`, so `yarn test 4` would check that file.

```sh
yarn test <num>
```

If you do not provide a test number ID, it will check all files.
